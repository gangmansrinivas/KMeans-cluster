# **Project Title:** analysis and prediction of "Mall_customers" of American mall called as phonix mall to find out how many customers are visited to a particular shop.On the basis this prediction annual income verses spending score 
# **Dicslamier:**In this particular dat set we assume annual income as centroid and spending score from the range 1-100 called as data nodes of the cluster
# **Problem Statement:**The Ammerican finance market as per the GDP of 2011 'phonix_trillums mall' as in range out of 5.The owner wants to exact which particular shop or product serach in different kind of clusters in entire mall
# As a data scince engineer predict the futurestic financial market for upcoming GDP rate based on number of cluster the clientwant atleat top 5 cluster(shops)
# **Project approach**

# **Conclusion:**According to the model basic prediction using KMeans clustering we found cluster 1 which consist red color is the heighet cluster which attach more than 50 data nodes
# **References:**The model building algorithem develop for all kinds of clusteration values.The yellow spots represent centroids which is maximise only 3
